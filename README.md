# Senior Design 2018-19
This is the repository for senior design (data science section) at Marquette University for Fall 2018 and Spring 2019. This is a year long walkthrough the data science research lifecycle focusing on understanding the spatio-temporal biases in police service requests in Milwaukee, WI. 

## Team
Our team is made up of six undergraduate data science majors from Marquette University. 

## Data
We will be focusing on data found at https://itmdapps.milwaukee.gov/MPDCallData/

This webpage contains a continually updating 60 minute window of 911 calls dispatched to Milwaukee Police Department. We have compiled a dataset containing several months of data from this window, with new data pushed daily. Certain aspects of data cleaning, such as geocoding, have been automated as well.

## Organization
If you wish to observe our internal project management and breakdown, view our trello board [here] (https://trello.com/b/FUvuNRk1/semester-1). Here you will find our tasks, what stage they are in, and which team members are primarily working on them. We are practicing an [agile methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), so the board updates regularly!
